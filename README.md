# YelpBark

YelpBark is a MEAN Stack app. This app is based off of Simon Holmes book, Getting Mean. 

YelpBark uses the MEAN stack technology along with user authentication to allow people to find the best places to bring their dogs and also leave reviews to help others know the best spots as well.

YelpBark is deployed on Heroku at: https://shrouded-badlands-46157.herokuapp.com/
